/*
 * You are managing a system that uses a 4-bit permission scheme to represent the access rights of a user. Each bit represents a specific permission:

 * Bit 3 (from left): Read
 * Bit 2: Write
 * Bit 1: Execute
 * Bit 0 (from left): Delete
 * Write a program that:
 *
 * Takes a 4-bit integer (0â€“15) as the current permissions.
 * Takes a bit position (0 to 3) as input and toggles (reverses)  * the bit at that position using bitwise operators.
 * Displays the new permission set after toggling the bit.
 *
 * Input:
 * Enter current permissions (0-15): 10
 * Enter the bit position to toggle (0-3): 2
 *
 * Output:
 * Original permissions: 1010
 * Updated permissions: 1110
